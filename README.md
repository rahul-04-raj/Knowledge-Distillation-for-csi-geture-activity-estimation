# Knowledge Distillation-Based AIoT Framework for Efficient Wireless Gesture Sensing in B5G/6G Networks â€“ Research Code Dump (IEEE Network Accepted)

Hey there!  
This repo has all the code, notebooks, and random experiments I did while working on my research paper that got accepted in **IEEE Network** ðŸŽ‰  
It's not super clean or production-ready, but it has everything I used, tested, and built while working on the project.
